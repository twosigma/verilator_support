Follow the following steps if you are installing(Verilog Perl) it for the first time.
You need to install Verilog Perl before running it. You can install it using
1) cpan install Verilog::Language (For more ways to install see http://www.veripool.org/projects/verilog-perl/wiki/Installing)
2) cpan install Verilog::EditFiles (You might need to install it as admin if make fails.)



This has been tested with Quartus 15.0.  YMMV, especially with other versions of Quartus.

You'll need to run something like:
$ altera_lib_mf.pl ${GEN_SRC_DIR} ${QUARTUS_DIR}/dist/quartus/eda/sim_lib/altera_mf.v
$ altera_lib_lpm.pl ${GEN_SRC_DIR} ${QUARTUS_DIR}/dist/quartus/eda/sim_lib/220model.v
